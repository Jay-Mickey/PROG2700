/*
Here's a simple and fun JavaScript exercise that introduces kids to cookies (the computer kind) and space exploration. In this exercise, we'll create a "Space Cookie Clicker" game where kids can click on a cookie to collect points and unlock space objects.

This game features a clickable cookie that kids can interact with to earn points. As they accumulate points, they unlock space objects (planet, rocket, and alien). The unlocked space objects become more visible and can be clicked on as well.*/

Your task is to modify the UI and functionality of this game.&nbsp;
